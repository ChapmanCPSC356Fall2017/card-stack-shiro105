## Summary
This application demonstrates the usage of Layouts in Android as well as using the one we found the most effective into creating a deck of cards. In particular, I looked at LinearLayouts, RelativeLayouts and FrameLayouts. For the deck of cards, I used the LinearLayout, since I found it to take the least amount of time to implement. It also was the most simple for this design, since cards are linear in design (for the scope of the assignment, we only had to base each card off of the Ace Card).
